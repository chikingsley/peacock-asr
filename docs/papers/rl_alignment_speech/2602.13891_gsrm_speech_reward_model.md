Recent advances in speech language models, such as GPT-4o Voice Mode and Gemini Live, have
demonstrated promising speech generation capabilities. Nevertheless, the aesthetic naturalness of
the synthesized audio still lags behind that of human speech. Enhancing generation quality requires
a reliable evaluator of speech naturalness. However, existing naturalness evaluators typically regress
raw audio to scalar scores, offering limited interpretability of the evaluation and moreover fail to
generalize to speech across different taxonomies. Inspired by recent advances in generative reward
modeling, we propose the Generative Speech Reward Model (GSRM), a reasoning-centric reward
model tailored for speech. The GSRM is trained to decompose speech naturalness evaluation into
an interpretable acoustic feature extraction stage followed by feature-grounded chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling explainable judgments. To achieve this, we curated a large-scale human feedback
dataset comprising 31k expert ratings and an out-of-domain benchmark of real-world user-assistant
speech interactions. Experiments show that GSRM substantially outperforms existing speech naturalness predictors, achieving model–human correlation of naturalness score prediction that approaches
human inter-rater consistency. We further show how GSRM can improve the naturalness of speech
LLM generations by serving as an effective verifier for online RLHF.

## 1 Introduction
Despite rapid progress in speech language models, such as GPT-4o Voice Mode Hurst et al. (2024) and
Gemini Live Comanici et al. (2025), the naturalness of synthesized speech still lags behind human audio,
with noticeable deficits in human-likeness, prosody, and emotional nuance, thus limiting the level of humanlike engagement in real-worl applications. Bridging this gap requires a reliable evaluator of speech naturalness
to guide the improvement of speech generation systems.
Traditional evaluators, including MOS predictors (Lo et al., 2019; Saeki et al., 2022; Baba et al., 2024; Wang
et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024; Hoq et al., 2025), enable scalable speech evaluation but ultimately reduce
perceptual judgments to a single scalar score. While effective for large-scale benchmarking, such metrics
provide limited insight into why a given speech sample is perceived as unnatural. Speech naturalness is
inherently multi-dimensional, including factors such as expressiveness, intonation, and pacing. Forcing a
single regressor to capture all these aspects often leads to poor generalization (Lo et al., 2019; Saeki et al.,
2022). As a result, scalar predictors can yield unreliable reward signals when used for online reinforcement
learning. In the broader text-based LLM literature, Generative Reward Models (GRMs) have recently emerged
as a promising alternative to scalar reward predictors. Rather than producing only a numerical score, GRMs
generate explicit reasoning traces alongside their evaluations, more closely aligning with how humans justify
judgments (Mahan et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025b; Zhang et al., 2024; Liang et al., 2025).
However, generative reward modeling remains relatively under-explored in the speech domain. AudioJudge Manakul et al. (2025) evaluates the ability of frontier speech LLMs to judge audio quality and par-

Expressive Intensity The degree of expressiveness, reflecting how emotionally vivid or subdued the speech sounds.
Expressive Correctness The appropriateness of the expressiveness w.r.t. the conversational context and semantic

alinguistic attributes through prompt engineering, revealing that most models struggle to produce reliable
judgments. WavReward Ji et al. (2025) finetunes a GRM to assess specific speech attributes such as age,
gender, pitch, and volume. Concurrent work likeSpeechJudge Zhang et al. (2025) extends generative reward
modeling to judge speech naturalness. While both SpeechJudge and our approach aim to construct synthetic
CoT reasoning, they differ fundamentally in how the CoT traces are produced. SpeechJudge synthesizes
CoT using a teacher speech LLM directly conditioned on the raw audio signal, resulting in reasoning that
is mediated by implicit acoustic representations the speech LLM can capture. In contrast, we explicitly
extract interpretable paralinguistic acoustic cues via signal processing and generate CoT using a text LLM
conditioned on these features. This explicit grounding enables systematic ablation of which acoustic factors
influence the predicted naturalness. Moreover, although GRMs have been used to improve text-to-speech
(TTS) systems Zhang et al. (2025), no prior work has leveraged these models to improve the naturalness of
a full-duplex speech LLM via online reinforcement learning.
To this end, we introduce GSRM, a Generative Speech Reward Model tailored for speech RLHF, with a
focus on speech naturalness evaluation. GSRM explicitly decomposes speech judgment into two stages: (1)
extracting interpretable paralinguistic acoustic features from raw audio, and (2) generating feature-grounded
CoT reasoning traces to produce final evaluations. We summarize our main contributions as follows:
1. High-quality Human Feedback Data. In Section 2, we curate a large-scale human feedback dataset for
speech naturalness, comprising 6.5K unique audio samples generated by controllable TTS systems. In
addition, we collect 490 dialogue samples generated by an internal speech LLM to emulate real-world
interactive scenarios.
2. Acoustic Feature–grounded Reasoning. Unlike existing approaches, GSRM explicitly extracts paralinguistic acoustic features from speech and reasons over this evidence to judge audio quality. Section 4
introduces a scalable CoT synthesis pipeline that enables the generation of high-quality, feature-grounded
reasoning trajectories.
3. Strong Empirical Performance. GSRM achieves human-level performance and substantially outperforming exisiting methods on naturalness prediction. Moreover, we take a first step toward online RLHF for
speech LLMs. In Section 5, by leveraging GSRM as a verifier, we successfully improve the naturalness of
a speech LLM through online reinforcement learning.
## 2 Human Feedback Data for Speech Naturalness
To reliably conduct speech naturalness assessment, we collect high-quality human annotations that capture
both fine-grained attributes and overall human-likeness of conversational speech. These annotations serve as
the foundation for training speech naturalness predictor.
Data Annotation Rubric. To assess speech naturalness, we design a structured annotation rubric that
decomposes naturalness into multiple relevant sub-metrics together with an overall human-likeness score.
Human raters evaluate each system response independently. All sub-metrics are rated on a 5-point Likert
scale, where higher values indicate better quality. One exception is for mispronunciation, which is annotated

using a categorical scale: 1 means a mispronunciation is present, 2 represents no mispronunciation, 3 means
not sure. The details are provided in Table 1.
Conversational TTS Dataset (ConvTTS). ConvTTS dataset is collected using an in-house TTS system
capable of producing two-channel dialogues. The model generates synthetic dialogue between a user and a
system by conditioning on reference speech examples along with textual instructions. The resulting datasets
contains 6,579 dialogue samples, each of length 49.4 ±19.3 seconds. We partition the samples into 4,579
training samples, 1,000 development samples, and 1,000 test samples, corresponding to 62.8, 13.7, and 13.8
hours of audio, respectively. Each sample is annotated for audio naturalness by human evaluators at the
dialogue level. A subset of the samples also include an additional rating of the assistant speech reponse,
totaling to 3,263 training, 711 development, and 717 test samples. On average, each audio recording is
labeled by 6.8 annotators, with the majority of samples evaluated by at least five different human raters.
Full-duplex Conversational Dataset (FDX-Conv). FDX-Conv dataset is collected from an in-house speech
LLM designed for full-duplex interaction, i.e., the system can listen and speak at the same time, allowing
overlapping user and system speech rather than strictly turn-based exchanges. The dataset contains 490
dialogue samples, each with an averaged duration of 41.1 ± 19.0 seconds. Similarly, each sample has been
rated by no fewer than five human raters. Since the speech is generated by a model distinct from the ConvTTS
system, we treat FDX-Conv as an out-of-domain (OOD) benchmark for assessing the generalization capability
of naturalness predictors.
Inter-Rater Consistency of Human-Likeness Ratings. To ensure the reliability of the collected annotations,
we measure inter-rater consistency for overall human-likeness ratings. Specifically, for each audio sample, we
randomly partition the set of annotators into two disjoint subsets, compute the average rating within each
subset, and measure the Pearson correlation coeﬀicient between the two averages. The Pearson correlation
coeﬀicients are 0.533 for ConvTTS and 0.532 for FDX-Conv (see Figure 6 in Appendix), indicating strong
inter-rater agreement. These results also serve as an empirical upper bound on the consistency between an
automatic naturalness predictor and human raters. We further analyze how individual sub-metrics relate to
the overall human-likeness score in Appendix E.1.
## 3 Pilot Studies for Naturalness Prediction
In this section, we conduct pilot studies to assess the limitations of existing modeling paradigms for predicting
speech naturalness. More details are included in Appendix C.
Direct Score Predictor. A natural baseline for speech naturalness prediction is to finetune a speech LLM to
perform direct score prediction. The model takes a speech recording as input and outputs numerical ratings for
individual sub-metrics, followed by an overall human-likeness score (e.g., human_likeness: 3.0), without
generating intermediate reasoning or chain-of-thought (CoT). We implement this baseline using Qwen2.5-

Omni-7B Xu et al. (2025). The model is fine-tuned on the ConvTTS training set and evaluated on both
the ConvTTS test set and the FDX-Conv OOD set. As shown in Table 2, this approach achieves Pearson
correlation coeﬀicients of 0.215 on the test set and 0.252 on the OOD set. While these results indicate that the
model captures some signal correlated with human judgments, a substantial gap remains compared to human
inter-rater consistency, highlighting the limitations of direct score prediction without explicit reasoning.
Frontier Speech Models Few-shot Prompting. Given the impressive speech generation capabilities of Gemini
Live Comanici et al. (2025), we next examine whether it can be directly leveraged to judge speech naturalness
via prompting. Prior work Manakul et al. (2025) suggests that frontier speech LLMs often struggle to identify
paralinguistic cues under zero-shot prompting, but that audio concatenation and in-context learning (ICL)
examples can offer improvements. Following Manakul et al. (2025), we randomly select five audio samples
with human-likeness ratings spanning 1 to 5 as ICL examples. The corresponding audio clips and their groundtruth ratings are concatenated and provided as few-shot context to Gemini-2.5-Pro in voice mode. We then
evaluate the model’s predictions on both the ConvTTS test set and the FDX-Conv OOD set. As shown
in Table 2, Gemini-2.5-Pro exhibits negative model–human correlation on the ConvTTS test set and only
weak correlation on the FDX-Conv OOD set. These findings indicate that, without downstream fine-tuning,
frontier speech models still struggle to reliably judge speech naturalness. This observation is consistent with
the conclusions of Manakul et al. (2025), which identify a notable gap between frontier speech models and
human listeners in understanding fine-grained paralinguistic information.
Frontier Text Model Acoustic Feature Prompting. Motivated by the limitations of frontier speech LLMs in
extracting paralinguistic cues, we explore whether frontier text-only LLMs can be more effectively leveraged
for speech naturalness judgment by conditioning on explicitly extracted acoustic features. For each speech
sample, we extract a set of paralinguistic features (details are described in Section 4). These features are
converted into structured textual descriptions and used to prompt a frontier text LLM to predict sub-metric
scores and an human-likeness rating. We evaluate this approach using Gemini-2.5-Pro in text-only mode
on both the ConvTTS test set and the FDX-Conv OOD set. As shown in Table 2, despite having no
direct access to raw audio, the text-based LLM leveraging explicit acoustic feature descriptions consistently
outperforms Gemini-2.5-Pro with speech prompting in both in-domain and OOD evaluations. These results
suggest that the primary bottleneck in using frontier speech LLMs for speech naturalness judgment lies not
in their reasoning capability, but in their ability to reliably extract and attend to fine-grained paralinguistic
cues from raw audio.
Remarks. These pilot studies suggest that effective speech naturalness prediction requires (i) extracting
explicit interpretable paralinguistic cues from waveforms, and (ii) a reasoning mechanism that reliably maps
such evidence to perceptual judgments. This motivates the design of the Generative Speech Reward Model
(GSRM), which integrates acoustic feature extraction with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning to emulate
how humans evaluate speech.
## 4 Generative Speech Reward Model
Our ultimate goal is to build a generative reward model tailored for speech, which first extracts inherent
paralinguistic evidence from speech and then reasons over this evidence to judge audio quality. While
our focus is speech naturalness evaluation, GSRM is designed as a universal framework that can assess any
attribute of speech through reasoning. At a high level, GSRM emulates the human evaluation process: human
raters implicitly attend to prosodic cues such as pitch movement, loudness variation, and timing, synthesize
these observations into quantitative judgments of overall naturalness. To train GSRM to achieve this, we

need two stages: (i) extracting structured acoustic features from the raw audio for downstream judgment,
and (ii) synthesizing explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories that connect these features to
quantitative ratings.
Table 3 Acoustic Features. Vowel-level prosodic features extracted from time-aligned vowel segments, serve as suﬀicient statistics
for speech naturalness judgment.
Acoustic Feature Definition and Interpretation
Pitch Level Average fundamental frequency (F0) of a vowel segment, reflecting overall pitch height.
Pitch Var. Within-segment variability of frequency, reflecting the degree of expressiveness.
Pitch Slope Trend of frequency change across the vowel segment (rising or falling), reflecting local intonation
contours.
Intensity Level Average loudness (e.g., RMS energy) of the vowel segment, reflecting perceived vocal strength or
emphasis.
Intensity Var. Temporal fluctuation of intensity within the vowel segment, indicating stability or variability in
loudness.
Duration Temporal length of the vowel segment, reflecting speech rate, emphasis, and pacing characteristics.
Acoustic Feature Extraction. Judging speech naturalness directly from raw audio is challenging due to
the high dimensionality and redundancy of waveform signals. From an information-theoretic perspective,
raw audio contains more information than is required to infer perceptual naturalness ratings. We therefore
assume the existence of a set of suﬀicient statistics Cover (1999) that preserves all information relevant
to naturalness judgment while discarding redundancy. In the context of speech evaluation, such suﬀicient
statistics naturally correspond to a set of interpretable acoustic features. Specifically, we adopt a vowel-level
acoustic feature extraction pipeline. Given an audio recording and its transcript, we perform phoneme-level
forced alignment to obtain precise temporal boundaries for each phoneme, and retain only vowel segments.
This is motivated by the observation that vowels, as voiced and acoustically stable units, carry the majority
of prosodic information relevant to expressiveness, intonation, and pacing.
As shown in Figure 2, for each vowel segment, we extract a compact set of low-level prosodic features as
summarized in Table 3. To improve robustness and interpretability, continuous feature values are discretized
into ordinal categories (e.g., very low, low, mid, high, very high). After feature extraction, we obtain a raw
acoustic feature log structured at the utterance level. For each utterance, the log records detailed vowel-level
acoustic analyses across the entire utterance, which serve as the main evidence for subsequent reasoning and

Table 4 Evidence Log Dimensions. Each utterance is analyzed along four dimensions to synthesize interpretable
reasoning grounded in acoustic features and transcript context.
Dimension Description
Inferred Context A concise description of the communicative intent of the utterance (e.g., question, acknowledgment, neutral statement), inferred from the transcript.
NSVs / Fillers Identification of any non-speech vocalizations or filler words (e.g., “yeah”, “uh”, “uh”), supported
by transcripts and acoustic feature such as abrupt pitch or intensity variation.
Positive Attributes Identification of perceptual strengths, such as appropriate emphasis, smooth intonation, or natural
fillers, grounded in specific vowels and their acoustic features.
Potential Issue Identification of perceptual weaknesses, including intonation instability, pacing inconsistency, expressive incorrectness, or unnatural pauses, grounded in specific vowels and their acoustic features.
naturalness judgment.
Reasoning Synthesis. While acoustic features capture essential paralinguistic evidence, they do not, by themselves, specify how such evidence should be interpreted to form perceptual judgments of speech naturalness.
Bridging this gap requires the synthesis of CoT reasoning that maps acoustic cues to ratings of each evaluation metrics and overall human-likeness. As shown in Figure 2, for each utterance in the raw acoustic feature
log, we provide a frontier text model (GPT-4o) with the utterance transcript and its associated vowel-level
acoustic features. The model is prompted to generate a structured analysis along four dimensions: inferred
conversational context, identification of non-speech vocalizations or fillers, positive perceptual attributes,
and potential issues (see Table 4). This process produces an utterance-level evidence log that articulates how
local prosodic patterns contribute to qualitative perceptual impressions. In the second stage, we synthesize a
global judgment CoT that maps the entire utterance-level evidence log to final human ratings. The model is
provided with both the evidence log and the oracle human ratings, and is instructed to generate a coherent
assessment explaining how the observed evidence supports the assigned scores. The final CoT trajectory used
for training is obtained by concatenating the utterance-level evidence log with the synthesized global judgment
CoT.
Training and Deployment. We synthesize CoT trajectories for all samples in the ConvTTS training set
to construct the training data for GSRM. We then fine-tune Qwen2.5-Omni-7B to take raw audio as input
and generate the corresponding synthesized CoT trajectories via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Through this
procedure, the model is encouraged to learn not only what ratings to assign, but also why those ratings
are justified given the underlying acoustic evidence. In addition, we explore whether reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can further improve naturalness prediction performance. The discussion is
provided in Appendix E.2. Once trained, GSRM is deployed in the same manner as a speech-in, text-out
LLMs. Given a raw audio recording, GSRM produces a textual CoT reasoning, followed by numerical ratings
for individual sub-metrics as well as an overall human-likeness score. To improve robustness, we further
employ test-time scaling by sampling multiple random predictions for the same audio input and averaging
the resulting scores. Empirically, we observe that using more test-time samples consistently improves model–
human consistency (see Section 6.2).
## 5 Towards Online RLHF for Speech LLM
In this section, we study how to leverage GSRM to improve the speech generation quality of a real-time
dialogue system, specifically, an in-house speech LLM through online reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF).
Extending GSRM to Speech Semantic Judgment. We first note that speech RLHF poses unique challenges
compared to text domain. Spoken responses convey rich information along two intertwined dimensions:
acoustic quality, including intonation and pacing, and semantic quality, such as contextual relevance and
coherence. To address this, we extend GSRM beyond acoustic evaluation to also judge the semantic quality
of speech. Following the same design principles used for naturalness prediction, we define a set of sub-metrics
for speech semantic quality, including language complexity, contextual awareness, and spontaneity. We then
collect a diverse training set consisting of textual transcripts of real audio responses generated by our in-house

speech LLM. These transcripts are annotated by a multi-agent framework, and high-quality CoT reasoning
is synthesized using a teacher model. Finally, we fine-tune GSRM on this synthesized dataset to perform
semantic judgment. Additional details are provided in Appendix D.1.
Applying GSRM to Online RLHF. Online reinforcement learning has been widely adopted to improve the
reasoning capabilities of text LLMs Zha et al. (2025); Shen et al. (2025); Guo et al. (2025), yet its potential
for improving the generation quality of speech LLMs remains largely unexplored. A key difference lies in
the nature of verification: while RL for reasoning tasks often relies on objective signals, RL for speech
generation requires subjective evaluation across multiple dimensions. GSRM provides a practical solution
to this challenge by serving as a universal verifier. As illustrated in Figure 3, given a user query, the
speech LLM produces spoken responses as rollouts in a real-time interaction loop. Each speech response is
transcribed into text using a lightweight automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, such as Whisper Radford
et al. (2023), to disentangle semantic content from acoustic characteristics. The generated speech and its
corresponding transcript are then provided to GSRM, which predicts ratings across multiple acoustic and
semantic dimensions. These ratings are aggregated into a scalar reward according to a predefined aggregation
rule. The generator is then iteratively updated by alternating between producing new speech samples and
receiving verification feedback from GSRM via an online RL algorithm.

## 6 Experiments
## 6.1 Settings.
Implementation Details. We adopt Qwen2.5-Omni-7B Xu et al. (2025) as the base model for GSRM due
to its strong speech understanding capabilities and eﬀicient inference. We synthesize SFT data using the
ConvTTS training set. For each audio sample, we average the ratings across annotators and round the result
to the nearest integer to obtain a single target score. For reasoning synthesis, we employ GPT-4o Hurst
et al. (2024) due to its strong text reasoning and instruction-following capabilities. This process yields 4,579
training examples, each consisting of a raw audio input paired with a synthesized CoT trajectory. We finetune the model with full-parameter training for 10 epochs. Additional details are provided in Appendix C.
Benchmark and Evaluation. We evaluate GSRM on both the in-domain ConvTTS test set and the OOD
FDX-Conv dataset. Since the ultimate goal of GSRM is to serve as a proxy for human judgment, we focus on
measuring consistency between model predictions and human ratings. For each test sample, GSRM generates
multiple predictions via random sampling. The final model prediction is obtained by averaging these outputs,
which is then compared against the averaged human rating. We report three evaluation metrics: (1) Pearson
correlation coeﬀicient (PCC), which measures linear agreement between model predictions and human ratings;
(2) Spearman correlation, which captures rank-order consistency and is robust to nonlinear relationships; and
(3) mean squared error (MSE), which measures the squared deviation between predictions and human ratings.
Unless otherwise stated, all main results are reported using average rating over 16 inference samples per test
instance.
Baseline Methods. In addition to the baselines introduced in Section 3, we compare GSRM against several
established naturalness predictors: (1) NISQA Mittag et al. (2021), a CNN-based model for predicting speech
naturalness and related perceptual attributes such as noisiness and loudness; (2) UTMOSv2 Baba et al. (2024),
which combines self-supervised speech representations with spectrogram features to estimate naturalness; and
(3) a WavLLM-based regressor, which is fine-tuned on our training data using the WavLLM Hu et al. (2024),
a self-supervised speech model pre-trained on 94k hours of audio. (4) an AES-based regressor, also fine-tuned
on our training data, using the AES Transformer Tjandra et al. (2025), a state-of-the-art model for audio
aesthetics assessment.
## 6.2 Main Results
Baseline Comparison. The main results are summarized in Table 5. We first observe that existing naturalness
predictors struggle to reliably assess speech naturalness, with many methods exhibiting near-zero or even
negative model–human correlation on the evaluation datasets. Also, acoustic feature prompting with GPT-4o
consistently outperforms speech prompting using Gemini-2.5-Pro, highlighting the effectiveness of explicitly
extracted acoustic features for naturalness judgment. While the AES-based predictor achieves competitive
performance, its generalization ability on the OOD dataset remains limited. In contrast, GSRM achieves
a PCC of 0.465 on the FDX-Conv OOD set, approaching human inter-rater consistency and substantially
outperforming all baseline methods.
Scaling Behavior of GSRM. We further analyze the scaling behavior of GSRM along two dimensions:
training data scale and test-time computation. First, we train GSRM with increasing amounts of data
({500,1000,2000,3000,4579} samples) and evaluate its PCC on the FDX-Conv OOD set. As shown in Figure 4(a), performance improves steadily with larger training sets, indicating that GSRM can further benefit
from more diverse and large-scale human-annotated data. Next, using the model trained on the full dataset,
we vary the number of test-time inference samples K ∈ {1,2,4,8,16} and average the resulting predictions.
Figure 4(b) shows that PCC increases monotonically as K grows, demonstrating that test-time scaling effectively reduces prediction variance. The most significant gains occur in the low budget regime (K = 1 to
K = 4), suggesting that robust naturalness prediction can be achieved with a reasonable inference cost.
## 6.3 Analysis
In this section, we conduct ablation studies to examine the contribution of evidence log, individual acoustic

Figure 5 Ablation Studies of Impact of Sub-metrics and Acoustic Features to Naturalness Prediction.
Ablation of Evidence Log. As illustrated in Figure 2, GSRM’s CoT trajectories consist of both an utterancelevel evidence log and a global judgment over the entire audio. To isolate the contribution of the evidence
log, we ablate it and train GSRM using only the global judgment CoT. As shown in Figure 5, removing the
evidence log results in a PCC drop of approximately 0.08. This degradation aligns with our intuition: the
utterance-level evidence log captures fine-grained local prosodic patterns, which provide essential context for
judging overall speech naturalness.
Ablation of Acoustic Feature. While evidence log is crucial, acoustic features provide the foundation for
generating such evidence log. To assess the importance of different feature groups, we independently ablate
pitch-, intensity-, and duration-related features during CoT synthesis and retrain GSRM under each condition. The resulting models are evaluated on the FDX-Conv OOD set. Figure 5 shows that pitch-based
features are the most critical for naturalness prediction, with PCC dropping by more than 0.12 when pitch
information is removed. Duration features exhibit a moderate impact, while intensity-based features contribute comparatively less. These findings align with prior observations that pitch dynamics are a dominant
cue in human perception of speech naturalness.
Ablation of Sub-metric. We next analyze the importance of individual sub-metrics. We keep the acoustic feature log fixed but ablate each sub-metric during CoT synthesis. For example, when the intonation
sub-metric is removed, GSRM is no longer allowed to reason about intonation when inferring the overall
human-likeness score. Figure 5 indicate that intonation and pacing are the most influential sub-metrics for
predicting naturalness, while non-speech vocalizations and fillers (NSVS) contribute the least. These trends
are consistent with the correlation analysis of human ratings in Figure 7, where intonation and pacing exhibit
the highest correlation with human-likeness, and NSVS and mispronunciation show the weakest correlations.

## 6.4 Results in the Wild: GSRM for Online RLHF
Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of GSRM in improving the naturalness of speech generation in an inhouse speech LLM through online RLHF. We start from an in-house speech LLM trained with supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), which serves as the base model. We then curate an RL training set consisting of 9.2k speech
prompts. For each prompt, the model is asked to generate a single-turn speech response, which is subsequently
evaluated by GSRM along multiple sub-dimensions. Additional details of the online RLHF training are
provided in Appendix D.2. After training, we compare the RLHF-trained model with the base SFT model.
Specifically, both models generate speech responses for a held-out test prompt set, and human raters conduct
A/B evaluations across multiple dimensions, including tone, pacing, intonation, and overall naturalness. Each
speech sample is evaluated by five independent human raters to ensure robustness. Table 6 demonstrate that
the RLHF-trained model outperforms the base model in terms of overall naturalness, winning the A/B
comparisons on 82% of the test samples. Moreover, RLHF training with GSRM consistently improves speech
generation quality across other sub-dimensions, further highlighting the effectiveness of GSRM as a reward
signal for online RLHF.
## 7 Concluding Remarks
We introduced the Generative Speech Reward Model, a reasoning-centric reward model tailored for speech naturalness evaluation and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Our empirical results demonstrate that GSRM substantially outperforms existing speech naturalness predictors. Importantly, we also
show that GSRM can serve as an effective verifier to improve the generation quality of a speech language
model. Looking ahead, we view GSRM as a foundational component for future speech alignment systems.
Beyond naturalness, the framework can be naturally extended to evaluate and optimize additional speech attributes, such as emotional expressivity, style consistency, and speaker similarity. More broadly, a promising
future direction is to explore advanced speech RLHF paradigms that jointly co-evolve the GSRM and the
generator within a unified RL framework, as has proven successful in reasoning domains Zha et al. (2025).

A Related Work
A.1 Speech and Audio Quality Prediction.
Automatic speech naturalness assessment has been widely studied through non-intrusive MOS predictors
that regress perceptual scores directly from audio. Early neural models such as MOSNet Lo et al. (2019)
demonstrated the feasibility of predicting naturalness without reference signals, while subsequent work improved robustness and coverage across speech synthesis and telephony scenarios, including NISQA Mittag
et al. (2021) and DNSMOS Reddy et al. (2021). More recent approaches, such as UTMOSv2 Baba et al.
(2024), leverage large-scale self-supervised speech representations to better match human judgments across
domains. Beyond speech-specific MOS prediction, audio aesthetics and quality models aim to assess broader
perceptual attributes across speech, music, and sound, such as Meta-AES Tjandra et al. (2025) and the
AudioMOS benchmark Huang et al. (2025). Despite strong empirical performance, these models operate as
black-box regressors that output scalar scores without interpretable justification, motivating the need for
generative reward models that explicitly reason over paralinguistic evidence.
A.2 Generative Reward Models.
Reward modeling has recently shifted from discriminative scoring toward generative formulations that produce explicit critiques or reasoning before assigning rewards. This paradigm includes LLM-as-a-judge approaches Li et al. (2025, 2024) and generative verifiers that cast reward modeling as a reasoning task Zhang
et al. (2024). DeepSeek further introduces inference-time scaling for generalist generative reward models,
13
demonstrating that aggregating multiple independently generated judgments significantly improves robustness and generalization Liu et al. (2025b). Related work such as GenRM Mahan et al. (2024) and J1 Whitehouse et al. (2025) shows that generative reward models can be iteratively improved via self-generated rationales and online reinforcement learning. While these approaches are now well-established in text domains,
analogous techniques for speech and audio remain under-explored.
In the speech domain, AudioJudge Manakul et al. (2025) evaluates the capability of frontier speech LLMs
to judge audio quality and paralinguistic attributes through prompt engineering, revealing that most models
struggle to provide reliable judgments. The most closely related concurrent works to GSRM are SpeechJudge Zhang et al. (2025) and WavReward Ji et al. (2025), which train speech LLMs to generate chainof-thought rationales for pairwise speech comparisons. While effective, both approaches rely on a teacher
speech LLM to generate reasoning, which can inherit whatever the teacher model has encoded about naturalness, despite its reliability. In contrast, GSRM decomposes reward modeling into explicit acoustic feature
extraction followed by feature-grounded generative reasoning, aligning more closely with how humans assess
fine-grained paralinguistic cues.
A.3 RLHF for Speech and Audio.
Applying reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to speech and audio generation is challenging due to the continuous and high-dimensional nature of audio signals, yet recent work has demonstrated
promising progress, primarily in text-to-speech (TTS) settings. SpeechJudge Manakul et al. (2025) applies
direct preference optimization (DPO) Rafailov et al. (2023) to post-train TTS models using human preferences. Other studies improve TTS quality using learned or proxy reward signals, including diffusion-based
reinforcement learning such as DLPO Chen et al. (2024) and offline preference optimization for text-to-audio
alignment Liao et al. (2024). Additionally, ASR-based rewards have been explored to enhance intelligibility and perceived naturalness of speech model outputs Liu et al. (2025a). Despite these advances, existing
RL-based approaches focus almost exclusively on single-utterance TTS or offline audio generation, and no
prior work has investigated leveraging online reinforcement learning to improve the naturalness of full-duplex,
interactive speech LLMs.
B GSRM Demo Examples
We present demo examples to illustrate how GSRM analyzes spoken responses and produces interpretable
judgments of human-likeness. Given any audio clip, the model generates an evidence log that explicitly
grounds its judgments in acoustic cues such as pitch variation, pitch slope, intensity, and duration, and aggregates these signals into sub-metric ratings and an overall score. Across examples with increasing ground-truth
human-likeness ratings, the model exhibits consistent behavior: lower-rated samples tend to show unstable
expressiveness, exaggerated pitch variation, or uneven pacing, while higher-rated samples demonstrate more
coherent intonation, appropriate expressive intensity, and smoother temporal dynamics.

[Summary Explaining the Ratings]
15
The audio recordings exhibit a range of expressive qualities, with some strengths in expressiveness and intonation, but also
some areas that could be improved. The expressiveness is generally dynamic, with varied pitch and intensity, although there
are instances where expressiveness could be more stable. Intonation is mostly clear, but there are occasional issues with
pitch variation that affect the naturalness of the delivery. The pacing is generally natural, but there are moments where it
becomes uneven. No non-speech vocalizations or fillers were detected, and there are no clear mispronunciations, although
some articulation could be stronger.
expressive_intensity: The audio demonstrates a good level of expressive intensity, with high pitch variation and clear pitch
slopes in several instances, such as in “oh, that’s so sweet” and “they gave him a warm bath.” However, there are moments
where expressiveness could be more consistent, such as in “i think i just had a tiny bit of fun imagining that puppy’s
adventures,” where the pitch in “think” is extremely high. Therefore, a rating of 3 is appropriate.
expressive_correctness: The expressiveness is generally appropriate and correct for the context, with the delivery matching
the inferred emotional tone of the statements. For example, the phrase “oh, that’s so sweet” is delivered with a positive and
engaging tone. However, the instability in expressiveness in some parts, like the high pitch in “think,” slightly detracts from
the overall correctness. Thus, a rating of 4 is suitable.
intonation: The intonation is mostly clear and contributes to a natural delivery, with good pitch variation in many parts.
However, there are some issues, such as the flat intonation in “i’m all ears” due to low pitch variation in “all.” These minor
issues suggest a rating of 4.
nsvs_and_fillers: No non-speech vocalizations or fillers were detected throughout the audio, indicating a clean and natural
delivery in this aspect. Therefore, a rating of 5 is warranted.
mispronunciation: There are no clear mispronunciations detected, although some articulation could be stronger, such as in
“family.” However, this does not constitute a mispronunciation. Thus, a rating of 2 is appropriate.
pacing: The pacing is generally natural, but there are moments of uneven pacing, such as the high duration of vowels in
“bath” and “bed,” which suggest potential pacing issues. Therefore, a rating of 3 is fitting.
overall_score: Taking into account all factors, including expressiveness, intonation, and pacing, the overall human likeness
of the audio is somewhat limited by the inconsistencies in expressiveness and pacing. Therefore, an overall score of 2 is
appropriate.

# Acoustic Features
<Detailed evidence log of the audio recording, including vowel-level analysis of each sentence.>
# Instructions
When evaluating the audio, you must rely on the acoustic features—Pitch, Pitch Variation, Pitch Slope, Intensity, and
Intensity Variation—as your primary evidence. Use them in the following expert-informed ways:
- Expressive Intensity: Identify the strength of expressiveness by looking for moderate to high Pitch Variation, clear Pitch
Slopes, and suﬀicient Intensity. Very low variation in pitch or intensity indicates a flat, emotionless delivery. Extremely high
variation may indicate unstable, exaggerated, or inconsistent expressiveness.
- Expressive Correctness: Evaluate whether the expressiveness is appropriate. Check if Pitch Variation and Intensity Variation
are coherent and context-appropriate, not abrupt or mismatched. Excessively sharp slopes or sudden changes in loudness
may suggest incorrect or unnatural expressiveness.
- Intonation Quality: Examine Pitch Slope to understand rising/falling contours, and Pitch Variation to assess natural melodic
movement. Smooth slopes and moderate variation indicate good intonation. Flat pitch indicates monotone delivery; abrupt
or irregular slopes indicate unstable intonation.
- NSVs and Fillers (Non-Speech Vocalizations): Look for sudden spikes in Intensity Variation or Pitch Variation that do not
align with vowel structure. Irregular or abrupt changes may reflect throat noises, glottal catches, or filler-like disfluencies.
- Mispronunciation: Evaluate vowels for abnormally low intensity, very short or weak articulation (if duration provided), or
unstable pitch contours. A vowel whose acoustic pattern deviates sharply from surrounding vowels may indicate mispronunciation.
- Pacing: Assess pacing consistency by checking whether the prosodic behavior across vowels is smooth and regular. Extreme
or uneven Intensity Variation or Pitch.

C.1.4 MOS Predictors.
We include existing utterance-level MOS predictors as baselines, specifically NISQA1
Mittag et al. (2021) and
UTMOSv2 Baba et al. (2024). Both models are originally designed for single-speaker, single-utterance speech
naturalness assessment and output a scalar MOS score. Since these predictors do not support multi-turn
conversational inputs, we apply them independently to each utterance within a conversation. For example, if a
conversation consists of five utterances, the predictor produces five corresponding MOS scores. Conversationlevel predictions are then obtained by aggregating the utterance-level scores using simple statistics, such as
the mean or minimum.
C.1.5 Regression-based Predictors.
In contrast to MOS predictors, regression-based predictors are explicitly trained to map conversational speech
representations to human-annotated MOS scores. These models follow a unified regression framework built
on top of large pre-trained speech encoders, including AES- and WavLM-based backbones. Given an input
conversation, the audio is segmented into fixed-length windows, and frame-level representations are extracted
using a frozen transformer encoder. A weighted sum of hidden states across all encoder layers is computed,

followed by temporal mean pooling to obtain a segment-level embedding. The resulting embeddings are then
passed through a multi-layer perceptron with GeLU activations and dropout, trained with mean squared
error loss to predict MOS scores. Final conversation-level predictions are obtained by averaging the regression
outputs across all segments.
C.2 Implementation Details of GSRM
C.2.1 Acoustic Feature Extraction.
Given a speech recording and its transcript, all audio is first resampled to 24 kHz. For multi-channel
recordings, only the first channel is retained (system response). Extended silences are removed using a
Silero-based voice activity detector with a merge threshold of 1000 ms to preserve natural intra-utterance
timing.
Phoneme-level forced alignment is then performed between the transcript and waveform using a neural
alignment model. From the resulting alignment, we retain only vowel segments. The vowel inventory is
defined using an IPA-based set covering both monophthongs and diphthongs. For each aligned vowel, two
temporal spans are defined. The full span, computed from the earliest onset to the latest offset across all
alignment states, is used to measure vowel duration. The core span is a stable sub-region used for pitch and
intensity estimation to avoid boundary transitions. When five or more alignment states are available, the
middle two states are selected; when three to four states are present, the central state is used; otherwise, 20%
of the full span is trimmed from each edge.
From each vowel segment, we extract a compact set of low-level prosodic features: (i) pitch level, defined
as the mean fundamental frequency (F0) over the core span; (ii) pitch variation, computed as the standard
deviation of F0; (iii) pitch slope, obtained via a linear fit to F0 over time; (iv) intensity level, measured as
mean RMS energy; (v) intensity variation, defined as the standard deviation of RMS energy; and (vi) duration,
defined as the length of the full span. Pitch extraction follows a Praat-style autocorrelation method with
speaker-adaptive floor and ceiling parameters, and all pitch and intensity statistics are computed only over
voiced frames.
Continuous feature values are normalized using a two-stage procedure. First, features are z-normalized at
the speaker level to control for individual vocal characteristics. Second, vowel-type normalization is applied
to mitigate systematic differences across vowel classes. The normalized values are then discretized into
ordinal categories. Specifically, pitch level is discretized using fixed thresholds at 85, 110, 160, 220, 280,
and 390 Hz, corresponding to extremely low, very low, low, mid, high, very high, and extremely high. Pitch
slope is categorized separately for rising and falling contours using the 25th and 75th percentiles of positive
and negative slopes, yielding low, mid, and high slope categories. Pitch variation, intensity level, intensity
variation, and duration are discretized via quantile-based binning at the 10th, 25th, 75th, and 90th percentiles,
producing five ordinal categories: very low, low, mid, high, and very high. Duration quantiles are computed
only from vowels with fully voiced cores.
The final output is an utterance-level acoustic feature log that records vowel sequences and their discretized
prosodic attributes in temporal order. We provide an example of the extracted vowel-level acoustic feature
log below.

C.2.2 Reasoning Synthesis.
After extracting the acoustic feature log for an audio sample, we leverage a teacher model, GPT-4o, to
synthesize the utterance-level evidence log. Specifically, for each utterance (sentence) and its associated
vowel-level acoustic features, we prompt GPT-4o to generate a structured analysis capturing the inferred
context, perceptual strengths, and potential issues of the utterance. We then concatenate the analyses of all
utterances to form the complete evidence log for the audio sample. The prompt template used for evidence
log synthesis is provided below.
Prompt Template: Synthesizing Utterence-level Evidence Log
You are an expert audio rater specializing in evaluating the quality of audio recordings. Your are given,
- A transcript of a spoken sentence.
- Acoustic features describing each vowel in the sentence.
- Evaluation metrics you must judge.
Your goal is to produce an analysis:
[Inferred context]:
question/empathetic/apology/celebration/instruction/neutral statement. If no clear context exists, say: “No clear context
inferred.”
[NSVs/fillers]:
List any non-speech vocalizations (NSVs) or filler words (laugh, yeah, Aww, uh, hmm, etc.) that are present in the audio. If
none exist, say: “No NSVs/fillers detected.”
[Positive]:
26
Highlight the most positive aspects of the audio: expressive intensity, good emphasis, varied intonation, natural fillers/laughs,
pleasant timbre. If no clear positive aspects exist, say: “No positive aspects detected.”
[Potential Issue]:
Point out any potential issues: sharp pitch changes, intonation problems, pacing issues, speaker style changes, expressive
incorrectness, mispronunciation, flat intonation, unnatural pauses, or any other issues. If no clear issue exists, say: “No
notable issues detected.”
# Evaluation Metrics
Each evaluation metric is described below:
- expressive_intensity: The intensity of expressiveness in the audio.
- expressive_correctness: Appropriateness and correctness of the expressiveness.
- intonation: Quality of the intonation in the speech.
- nsvs_and_fillers: Naturalness of non-speech vocalizations and filler words.
- mispronunciation: whether mispronunciation is present.
- pacing: Naturalness of the pacing or speed of the speech.
# The system responses and acoustic features:
{Acoustic features}
# Instructions
When evaluating the audio, you must rely on the provided acoustic features—Pitch, Pitch Variation, Pitch Slope, Intensity,
and Intensity Variation—as your primary evidence.
Use them in the following expert-informed ways:
- Expressive Intensity: Identify the strength of expressiveness by looking for moderate to high Pitch Variation, clear Pitch
Slopes, and suﬀicient Intensity. Very low variation in pitch or intensity indicates a flat, emotionless delivery. Extremely high
variation may indicate unstable, exaggerated, or inconsistent expressiveness.
- Expressive Correctness: Evaluate whether the expressiveness is appropriate. Check if Pitch Variation and Intensity Variation
are coherent and context-appropriate, not abrupt or mismatched. Excessively sharp slopes or sudden changes in loudness
may suggest incorrect or unnatural expressiveness.
- Intonation Quality: Examine Pitch Slope to understand rising/falling contours, and Pitch Variation to assess natural melodic
movement. Smooth slopes and moderate variation indicate good intonation. Flat pitch indicates monotone delivery; abrupt
or irregular slopes indicate unstable intonation.
- NSVs and Fillers (Non-Speech Vocalizations): Look for sudden spikes in Intensity Variation or Pitch Variation that do not
align with vowel structure. Irregular or abrupt changes may reflect throat noises, glottal catches, or filler-like disfluencies.
- Mispronunciation: Evaluate vowels for abnormally low intensity, very short or weak articulation (if duration provided), or
unstable pitch contours. A vowel whose acoustic pattern deviates sharply from surrounding vowels may indicate mispronunciation.
- Pacing: Assess pacing consistency by checking whether the prosodic behavior across vowels is smooth and regular. Extreme
or uneven Intensity Variation or Pitch Variation may reflect rushed or unnatural pacing. If duration is given, long durations
imply slow pacing; short durations imply fast pacing.
# Response Format
Your response must strictly follow this format:
[Inferred context]
<one concise sentence describing the inferred context, referencing the transcripts as evidence.> OR “No clear context inferred.”
[NSVs/fillers]
<one concise sentence listing any NSVs/fillers, referencing the transcripts and features as evidence.> OR “No NSVs/fillers
detected.”
[Positive]
<one concise sentence highlighting positive aspects of the evaluation metrics, referencing the features as evidence.> OR “No
positive aspects detected.”
[Potential Issue]
<one concise sentence describing weaknesses, referencing the features as evidence.> OR “No notable issues detected.”
# Important
- Always refer specifically to the words and vowels in the transcript as evidence. Do Not say something too generic without
referencing the features.
- Although always use features and transcripts as evidence, Do Not explicitly mention something like “Based on the features
and transcripts, I judge the audio as follows:” in your response.
Once the evidence log is constructed, we prompt GPT-4o again to synthesize a global judgment chain-ofthought (CoT). We adopt a role-playing prompt that grants the model access to both the evidence log and
the ground-truth human ratings, and instructs it to explain the reasoning behind the assigned scores. This
design ensures that the synthesized reasoning is faithful to the oracle ratings while remaining coherent. The
prompt template for global judgment synthesis is shown below.

We use a learning rate of 2 × 10−5
with a cosine learning rate scheduler. The batch size is set to 32, the
maximum sequence length is 4096, and the model is trained for up to 10 epochs. During inference, we select
the model checkpoint with the lowest validation loss on a held-out validation set. For each audio sample,
we perform up to 16 random inference passes with a sampling temperature of 1.0 and top-p set to 0.6. The
final rating is obtained by averaging the scores across these samples. All experiments are conducted using
the SWIFT framework Zhao et al. (2024).
D Details of Online RLHF for Speech LLM
D.1 GSRM for Speech Semantic Judge
We extend GSRM to evaluate semantic aspects of speech naturalness across dimensions such as language
complexity, contextual awareness, and spontaneity, as detailed in Table 7. A model’s response may sound
aesthetically natural—with near-perfect pacing and intonation—yet still fail semantically, for example by
ignoring conversational context, responding with inappropriate affect (e.g., being overly cheerful or rude to a
sad query), or drifting completely off-topic. Similarly, responses that are excessively verbose or overly formal
can undermine both spontaneity and the perceived naturalness of language complexity. Importantly, these
failure modes can be identified purely from the text transcript.
Label and CoT Generation. In contrast to Section 2 where GSRM for audio naturalness required human
annotations for dialogue-level dimension scores, we use advanced text-only reasoning models that are carefully
prompted to produce binary scores for each dimension of semantic naturalness. We initially experimented with
29
Table 7 Annotation Rubric for Speech Semantic Quality. Each dialog transcript is evaluated along multiple subdimensions that capture different aspects of speech semantic quality.
Sub-metric Description
Language Complexity For language complexity, consider two main aspects: 1. Vocabulary & Wording – Favor
responses that use colloquial language, idiomatic expressions, contractions (e.g., “can’t”,
“it’s”), deixis (e.g., “this”, “that”, “here”), and, where appropriate, mild slang. Penalize
responses that use overly formal, esoteric, or academic vocabulary, as well as robotic or
non-idiomatic phrasing. 2. Syntax – Favor simple, straightforward sentence structures.
Look for short sentences, frequent pauses, and incremental phrasing (e.g., “Yeah, and
then…”), which contribute to a natural rhythm and pacing. Penalize sentences that
are too long without breaks, or that use unnecessarily complex syntax. Consider the
following questions — Does the assistant’s response sound like something a real person
would say in a casual spoken conversation? Is the language accessible and easy to follow
in verbal conversation? Are there any words, phrases, or sentence structures that feel
unnatural, overly formal, or robotic for spoken dialog?
Contextual Awareness Consider three main aspects: 1. Contents – Favor responses that are straightforward
and direct, frontloading key information. Penalize responses that are off-topic, irrelevant,
circuitous, indirect, or simply repeat the user’s query. Adjust for context: In emergencies
or urgent situations, concise and directive speech is preferred. In teaching scenarios or
when the user requests details, more elaborate explanations are appropriate. 2. Length
– Favor brief responses that are clear and complete, while avoiding unnecessary terseness.
Penalize responses that are long-winded or contain unnecessary elaboration. 3. Tone –
Favor a friendly, approachable, and engaging tone by default. Adjust tone based on user
cues: If the user is upset, the assistant should soften its tone and convey understanding
or empathy. If the user is excited, the assistant should respond with enthusiasm. Always
match the tone to the context and user sentiment
Spontaneity A response is considered spontaneous if it includes one or more of the following features,
which are typical of authentic, on-the-fly human speech (as long as they do not significantly harm clarity or delivery, e.g., by making the response confusing or incoherent):
Frequent checks: Phrases like “you know?”, “right?”, or similar, used to engage or check
understanding. Self-repairs: Corrections or adjustments to previous statements, e.g., “I
mean...”. Clarifications: Paraphrasing, moderate repetition, or rephrasing to ensure the
message is easy to understand. Disfluency: Natural filler words (“like”, “well”, “hmm”,
”so”), restarts, or false starts. A response is considered non-spontaneous if it lacks these
features and instead sounds polished, rehearsed, or as if being read from a script.
several frontier models, including Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o, and Llama 3.1, and ensembled their predictions to
derive a final dimension-level score for each dialogue. However, we ultimately converged on GPT-OSS-120B
(Agarwal et al., 2025), which produced labels that best matched our internally curated golden labels across
dimensions.
To reduce variance in the judge’s labels and approximate multi-rater human evaluation, we sample 10 independent judgments per dialogue per dimension and then take the majority vote as the final dimension score.
Rather than simply summing these dimension scores into a single naturalness metric, we further prompt
GPT-OSS-120B to consider the oracle per-dimension scores and the dialogue context to produce a final semantic naturalness score between 0 and 3 along with a CoT reasoning as shown in the prompt template
below.
Prompt Template: GSRM for Speech Semantic Quality Training & Inference
You are a semantic quality evaluation expert tasked with assessing the assistant’s responses in a user-assistant conversation.
Evaluate the assistant based on 3 criteria: Spontaneity, Language Simplicity, and Context Awareness.
[Instructions]
1. Review the conversation between the user and the assistant. 2. For each criterion, provide a score (0 or 1) and a concise
reasoning (<=50 words) referencing specific assistant responses.
# Evaluation Metrics
1. Spontaneity: A response is considered spontaneous if it includes features typical of authentic human speech, such as:
- Frequent checks (e.g., ”you know?”, ”right?”),
- Self-repairs (e.g., ”I mean...”),
- Clarifications (e.g., paraphrasing, moderate repetition),
- Disfluency (e.g., natural filler words, restarts, or false starts).
30
A response is non-spontaneous if it lacks these features and sounds polished, rehearsed, or scripted.
## 2 Language Complexity: Evaluate the language complexity based on two aspects:
- Vocabulary & Wording: Favor colloquial language, idiomatic expressions, contractions, and mild slang. Penalize overly
formal, esoteric, or academic vocabulary, and robotic or non-idiomatic phrasing.
- Syntax: Favor simple, straightforward sentence structures, short sentences, and incremental phrasing. Penalize long,
complex sentences without breaks. Consider if the response sounds like natural spoken conversation and is easy to follow.
3. Context Awareness: Assess if the assistant demonstrates understanding of the user’s intent and situation, and adapts its
response accordingly in:
- Contents: Favor direct, relevant, and concise responses, adjusting for context (e.g., emergencies, teaching scenarios).
- Length: Favor brief, clear, and complete responses, avoiding unnecessary elaboration.
- Tone: Favor a friendly, approachable tone, adjusting based on user cues (e.g., upset, excited).

# Response Format
Assign an overall score (0-3) based on the sub-dimension scores and other aspects of the assistant’s response. Consider the
sub-dimension scores as a guide, but also look for other cues in the assistant’s response that may not be captured by these
criteria. A score of 3 indicates a perfect human-like conversation transcript, while a score of 0 indicates a response that
is clearly robotic, inappropriate, or scripted. Use your judgment to weigh the importance of each sub-dimension score and
other factors in determining the overall score.

Now evaluate the following dialog: {dialog}”
Training and Evaluation. We fine-tuned a Qwen-2.5-Omni-7B model to predict sub-dimension scores, the
overall naturalness score, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning traces from user-assistant dialogue transcriptions. As an ablation to understand the impact of including CoT reasoning, we also trained a model to
directly predict the overall naturalness score without generating CoT traces, similar to direct score predictor
in Section 3.
Labels and CoT reasoning traces were generated in-house on samples produced by an ensemble of different
audio foundation models, using audio prompts designed to elicit emotional responses. Our training dataset
consisted of 11,000 such samples. In-domain (on-policy) evaluation was performed on 100 samples from the
same distribution as the training set, while for out-of-domain (OOD) evaluation, we collected labels on 130
samples from the FDX-Conv dataset described in Section 2.
All models were trained for 250 steps with a batch size of 512. The model trained with chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning converged rapidly, reaching convergence within 95 steps. In contrast, the direct score predictor
baseline required approximately 200 steps to converge. As will be discussed in Section E.3, incorporating CoT
reasoning leads to faster convergence, substantially improved generalization, and stronger correlation with
ground-truth semantic labels. These results highlight the effectiveness of framing semantic reward modeling
31
as a generative task.
D.2 Applying GSRM to Online RLHF
Base Model and RLHF Data. The base model is an in-house full-duplex speech LLM capable of listening and
speaking simultaneously. While the user is speaking, the model can continuously generate spoken responses
while understanding the user’s input. The model is trained on a large-scale speech corpus through a pretraining stage followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The goal of RLHF training is to reduce the gap in
naturalness between the speech LLM and human speech. To incentivize the generation of more natural speech,
we curate an RLHF training dataset consisting of 9.2K samples, where the speech prompts were collected by
voice actors who are instructed to choose a category from intelligence, steer ability, and emotional well being.
RL Training. We adopt GRPO Guo et al. (2025) as our online reinforcement learning algorithm, which
removes the critic from PPO Schulman et al. (2017) and estimates the value function by averaging rewards
within a group. For each input prompt, the speech LLM generates four candidate responses, which are then
scored by GSRM. Specifically, GSRM evaluates each response across all sub-dimensions listed in Table 1,
together with language complexity as a semantic metric. Each sub-metric is scored on a 5-point Likert scale,
and the final reward is obtained by uniformly averaging all sub-metric scores. To reduce variance in reward
estimation, we run GSRM inference 20 times per response, producing eight independent judgments, and use
their average as the final reward. We use a policy learning rate of 4×10−7
. The batch size is set to 320, the
maximum sequence length is 8192, and the KL coeﬀicient is set to 1 × 10−2
. The Speech LLM is trained for
up to 2000 steps.
Evaluation. For evaluation, we randomly sample 50 audio prompts from an in-house evaluation dataset.
The prompts span multiple categories, including chitchat, paralinguistics, steerability, and emotional wellbeing. These speech prompts are collected from human volunteers, who record their own spoken questions
corresponding to each category. For each prompt, both the RLHF-trained model and the base model generate
speech responses. Human raters then perform A/B evaluations on the paired responses across multiple
dimensions, including tone, pacing, intonation, and overall naturalness using the rubric shown below.
Each response pair is generated from the same prompt and evaluated independently by five different reviewers.
To ensure consistency, we perform quality checks to verify that the pairwise preferences align with the
preferences derived from comparing the absolute naturalness scores. For each response pair, we determine
the final overall naturalness preference by removing outlier ratings and applying a majority vote across the
reviewers. The win rate for each model is then calculated as the total number of wins (as determined by the
overall preference) divided by the total number of evaluated samples.
For the intermediate sub-dimensions, we determine model preference by directly comparing the absolute
scores. A preference ranking is only requested in the event of a tie. These intermediate questions are designed
to guide the rater toward an informed final decision, while remaining concise to minimize the cognitive load
associated with completing multiple annotations in one sitting.

a human talking to an AI chat bot. Please listen carefully to the conversation and then answer the questions below.
After listening, you are asked a series of multiple-choice questions comparing the two responses regarding the AI chat bot
(the answering voice, not the asking voice). Do not overthink your response; choose the option that best matches your
observation.”
Dimension 1: Pace
Prompt. “Did response A/B maintain an organic, natural pace? Think about the length of pauses and the usage of filler
words (e.g., ‘uhm’, ‘uh’) and similar nonverbal cues.” Per-response scale (A and B, separately):
## 1 Yes, natural flow, indistinguishable from a human.
## 0 No, pacing was jarring or hard to listen to.
Tiebreaker (pairwise preference, only if A and B are rated the same): -1 Prefer audio A 1 Prefer audio B
32
Dimension 2: Intonation
Prompt. “How appropriate was response A/B’s intonation (pitch curve)? Was it jarring, or indistinguishable from a human?”
Per-response scale (A and B, separately):
## 1 Indistinguishable from a human.
## 0 Clearly jarring / sounds like a robot.
Tiebreaker (pairwise preference, only if A and B are rated the same): -1 Prefer audio A 1 Prefer audio B
Dimension 3: Emotion and Tone
Prompt. “Did response A/B’s emotion and tone fit the situation and context of the dialogue?” Clarification shown. “For
example, the assistant should match the user’s perceived emotional state; it should not be too cheerful, energetic, lethargic,
or disrespectful given the user’s content and tone.” Per-response scale (A and B, separately):
1 Yes, appropriate (“nailed it”).
0 Not appropriate (e.g., too cheerful, bored, or disrespectful).
Tiebreaker (pairwise preference, only if A and B are rated the same): -1 Prefer audio A 1 Prefer audio B
Dimension 4: Overall Naturalness and Preference
Pairwise preference (A vs. B). Prompt. “Which response appears more natural / human-like?” Scale:
## 1 Strongly prefer audio A.
## 2 Slightly prefer audio A.
## 3 No clear preference (undecided).
## 4 Slightly prefer audio B.
## 5 Strongly prefer audio B.
X Technical diﬀiculty.
X Skip.
Absolute naturalness for each response. Prompt. “Was the response for audio A/B natural / human-like?” Per-response
scale (A and B, separately):
## 5 Indistinguishable from a human, even for a trained ear.
## 4 Sounds like a human for most listeners.
## 3 Somewhat natural, but sometimes unnatural.
2 Barely human; could tell it is a robot.
## 1 Clearly recognizable as a robot.
X Technical diﬀiculty.
X Skip.
Free-text rationale. For each response, raters provide a brief explanation of their choice, e.g., commenting on over-acting,
mismatch between tone and context, unnatural pauses, excessive sighs, or other artifacts.

We further analyze how individual sub-metrics relate to the overall human-likeness score. For each sub-metric,
we compute the Pearson correlation coeﬀicient between the sub-metric ratings and the corresponding humanlikeness ratings. The results shown in Figure 7 indicate that intonation and pacing exhibit strong correlations
with human-likeness, while expressive intensity and expressive correctness show moderate correlations. In
contrast, non-speech vocalizations and fillers and mispronunciation exhibit relatively weak correlations with
the overall human-likeness score.
E.2 Training GSRM via Reinforcement Learning
GSRM performs a speech-in, text-out reasoning task. Since reinforcement learning has been shown to be
effective for improving reasoning capabilities in large language models, we investigate whether reinforcement
learning can further enhance GSRM’s performance on speech naturalness prediction. A common training
paradigm for reasoning-oriented LLMs consists of a small-scale supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up stage
followed by large-scale reinforcement learning Guo et al. (2025); Shen et al. (2025). We follow this paradigm
by first fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Omni-7B with 500 supervised samples. We then apply reinforcement learning
using GRPO Guo et al. (2025) on the remaining 4,079 samples.
A key challenge in reinforcement learning is reward design. We consider two reward modeling strategies. The
first uses the negative ℓ2 distance between the predicted score ŷ and the ground-truth rating y∗
, defined as
−∥y∗
−ŷ∥. The second uses an RBF kernel to measure similarity between ŷ and y∗
, defined as exp
(
−(y∗
−ŷ)2
2σ2
)
.
Models trained with these two reward formulations are evaluated on the out-of-domain (OOD) test set and
compared against a GSRM trained using full supervised fine-tuning on all 4,579 samples.
The comparison results are shown in Table 8. Notably, when trained with the ℓ2-distance reward, the model
collapses to predicting nearly constant scores across different inputs. This behavior indicates reward hacking:
rather than accurately matching human ratings, the model converges to a conservative prediction strategy
that minimizes expected penalty. In contrast, the nonlinear RBF-kernel reward mitigates this issue and yields
modest improvements over the warm-up SFT model. However, the RL-trained models still underperform the
model trained with full supervised fine-tuning.
Based on these observations, we hypothesize that the base model Qwen2.5-Omni-7B lacks suﬀicient prior
knowledge for analyzing paralinguistic cues and judging speech naturalness. Supervised fine-tuning therefore

plays a critical role as a knowledge injection stage, enabling the model to acquire the necessary skills for
speech evaluation. While incorporating reinforcement learning alone is insuﬀicient in this case, a promising
direction for future work is to introduce substantial amounts of speech judgment data during pre-training or
mid-training stages, which we leave for future investigation.
E.3 Results of GSRM for Speech Semantic Judge
Table 9 Main Results of GSRM for Speech Semantic Judge. Pearson correlation coeﬀicients between ground-truth scores and
different scoring strategies for speech semantic reward model trained with and without CoT reasoning, evaluated in-distribution
(ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD).
ID OOD
Setup Mean Median Rounded Mean Mean Median Rounded Mean
without CoT reasoning 0.803 0.810 0.810 0.706 0.677 0.659
with CoT reasoning 0.886 0.874 0.884 0.834 0.835 0.837
As discussed in Section D.1, we trained two semantic reward models, our proposed model: a generative reward
model with CoT reasoning and a baseline without any CoT reasoning that only predicts the naturalness score.
We evaluate these two models on an in-domain evaluation set of 100 samples and an OOD dataset of 130
samples. We extract a final score for each dialogue using standard nucleus sampling with temperature of 1.0
and top-p = 0.6. For each dialogue, we sample 10 independent predictions and then apply an aggregation
rule to obtain a single scalar score. As shown in Table 9, our proposed method achieves the strongest
performance, with superior generalization on OOD data. After aggregating the 10 predictions into a single
score we compute the pearson correlation coeﬀicient against the ground-turth score. Among aggregation
strategies, the rounded mean works particularly well, similar to the audio naturalness GSRM discussed in
the main text. The results also highlight the benefits of training with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning: it
not only improves score prediction on in-domain data but also substantially enhances OOD generalization,
addressing a common failure mode of classical regression-based reward modeling.

Figure 10 Confusion matrices on predictions of sub-dimension scores from model trained with CoT reasoning.
The confusion matrices presented in Figures 8 and 9 demonstrate that incorporating CoT reasoning enables
the reward model to achieve substantially higher accuracy, particularly for samples at the extremes of the
naturalness spectrum (i.e., scores of 0 and 3). Notably, this improvement persists even on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data, despite the limited number of samples with low naturalness scores.
Finally, Figure 10 illustrates the performance of our model, trained with CoT reasoning, in predicting subdimension scores for language complexity, spontaneity, and contextual awareness. The model achieves an
agreement rate exceeding 85% for both language complexity and spontaneity. However, its performance
in identifying a lack of contextual awareness, particularly in lower-quality samples, remains an area for
improvement. We anticipate that incorporating additional negative samples targeting this sub-dimension in
future training iterations will further enhance the model’s predictive capabilities.
